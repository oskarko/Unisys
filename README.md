Technical test for Unisys company

# Documentation:
- I have selected MVVM + Coordinator pattern because it's easier to test all the logic related to the business App. Also, you have a total control of all classes in order to preserve that each class has just one thing to do.
- Calling to the API has been made without any third library. In my opinion it is not necessary nowadays at all.
- Data Persistant has been made throught Core Data.
- Using Coordinators as a pattern for views transictions make really EASY our live and clean our code a lot. This MVVM + Coordinator is like a pseudo VIPER but with less boilerplate code.
- Just for lack of time, I did NOT add any other extra feature: Dark mode,  localized strings...

# How to test
- Clone the project
- Get an APIKey from [https://newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/) and paste it in the Constants file.
